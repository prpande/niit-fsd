- Cracking the Coding Interview by Gayle Laakmann McDowell

### Courses

- Algorithms 1 and Algorithms 2 by Princeton University on Coursera (Skipped the Advance Sections)

### Youtube channels

- William Fiset's Data Structure Playlist
- Tushar Roy's DP and Graph Playlist
- Abdul Bari Sirs Algorithm Playlist

### Practicing coding problems

- LeetCode

## System Design Interviews

### Books

- Designing Data Intensive Applications by Martin Klepmann

### Courses

## Low Level Design Interviews

### Books

- Head First Design Patterns

### Courses

- Grokking the Object Oriented Design Interview on Educative

## Behavioral Interviews

- For this, I created a doc listing down the most commonly asked questions and wrote answers based on my work experience and projects following the STAR framework.

## Mock Interviews

- Pramp: I used this few weeks before my interviews to practice in an interview setting.

## Taking Notes

- Notion: This is one of my favorite applications. I use this to take notes and organize information. You can get the basic plan for free if you have your college email id.
