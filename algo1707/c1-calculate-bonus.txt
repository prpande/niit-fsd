Challenge 1: Calculate the Bonuses for the Employees
====================================================

Algorithm
---------

Step1: Start
Step2: Accept n as number of employees
Step3: Initialize totalBonus to 0, highestBonus to 0, salesEmployeeCount to 0
Step4: Accept employee data
Step5: If the employee is from Sales, then perform Steps 6,7 and 8
Step6: Calculate and display individual employeeBonus = 0.02*monthlySalary
Step7: If employeeBonus is greater than highestBonus, then assign employeeBonus to highestBonus
Step8: Add employeeBonus to totalBonus and increment salesEmployeeCount
Step9: Repeat Steps 4,5,6,7,8 for all n employees
Step10: Display totalBonus, highestBonus and averageBonus equal to totalBonus/salesEmployeeCount
Step11: End

        BEGIN
            SET employeeBonus = 0.02 * employeeData.monthlySalary
            PRINT employeeData.Name + ":" + employeeBonus
            totalBonus = totalBonus + employeeBonus
            salesEmployeeCount = salesEmployeeCount + 1
            IF employeeBonus > highestBonus
            BEGIN
                highestBonus = employeeBonus
            ENDIF
        ENDIF
    ENDFOR
    SET avgBonus = totalBonus / salesEmployeeCount
    PRINT "Average Bonus:" + avgBonus
    PRINT "Highest Bonus:" + highestBonus
    PRINT "Total Bonus:" + totalBonus
