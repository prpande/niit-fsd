            <h2>Flexbox</h2>

            <p>Flexbox is a one-dimensional layout method for arranging items in rows or columns. Items flex (expand) to
                fill additional space or shrink to fit into smaller spaces..</p>

            <h2>Why Flexbox?</h2>

            <p>For a long time, the only reliable cross-browser compatible tools available for creating CSS layouts were
                features like floats and positioning. These work, but in some ways they're also limiting and
                frustrating. Some of the simple layout designs are either difficult or impossible to achieve with such
                tools. Flexbox makes a lot of layout tasks much easier.</p>

            <h2>How Flexbox Works?</h2>

            <p>To start with, we need to select which elements are to be laid out as flexible boxes. To do this, we set
                a special value of display on the parent element of the elements you want to affect.</p>

            <p>The element we've given a display value of flex to is acting like a block-level element in terms of how
                it interacts with the rest of the page, but its children are laid out as flex items. The next section
                will explain in more detail what this means. Note also that you can use a display value of inline-flex
                if you wish to lay out an element's children as flex items, but have that element behave like an inline
                element.
