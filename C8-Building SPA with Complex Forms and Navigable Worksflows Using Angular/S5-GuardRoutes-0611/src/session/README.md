## Sprint 5 : Guard Routes in an SPA

This sprint has 2 demos

[**Demo 1 :: Prevent Unauthenticated Access in Fruit-Fantasy app**](./demo-1/)

###### Problem Statement

The Fruit-Fantasy application allows users to add, view, modify and delete fruit details.

The application should ensure that these views are accessible only to the user with valid vendor code. If an unauthenticated user attempts to navigate to these views, the user should be redirected to the login view.

**Note:** Routes should be guarded in the `Fruit-Fantasy` app. Use the solution code developed in the `Demo 4: Enable Navigation from Fruit-Detail to Home View​` of `Sprint 4: Implement Navigation using Angular Routing`

[**Demo 2 :: Prevent Losing Unsaved Changes​**](./demo-2/)

###### Problem Statement

The Fruit-Fantasy app allows vendors to update fruit details.

The application should ensure that the navigation is not allowed to any other component, if the changes are not saved upon update. 

**Note:** To develop the solution for `fruit-fantasy` app , modify the solution code developed in the `Demo 1: Prevent Unauthenticated Access in Fruit-Fantasy app` of this sprint.
