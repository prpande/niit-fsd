# Course : Building Interactive Web Application using JavaScript

## KeepApp Challenge (Progressive)

1. User can add note
    - addition would be successful only if all validations are satisfied
    - for invalid inputs, error message should be displayed in red
2. User can view all notes
    - view should immediately update without complete page load when a note is added or deleted
    - existing view should be retained post addition or deletion of note
3. User can delete note
    - prior to delete, user should be requested for confirmation
4. User can toggle the view (grid <-> list)
    - view should change without complete page reload
5. User can read the note statistics (with pleasing and clear UI)
    - count of notes with status `not started`
    - count of notes with status `in progress`
    - count of notes with status `completed`
    - no. of notes added vs. no. of notes completed in a month range
6. User can filter notes by (option should be available on all views)
    - title
    - status
7. User should login to manage notes ?? (currently not included in sprint design, could include it in place of dashboard feature to adhere to the given duration)

**NOTE**

1. UI should be responsive
2. Icons preferred in place of text on button and menu labels
3. Files should be organized in a proper folder structure
4. Multiple script files can be added for clutter free, reusable code
