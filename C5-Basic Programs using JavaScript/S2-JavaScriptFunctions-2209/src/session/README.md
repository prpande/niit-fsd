# Sprint 5: Implement Modular Programming Using Functions

## This sprint has 6 demos

### Demo 1: Simple Functions

Working with JavaScript Functions:

1. Display welcome message
2. Calculate the sum of 2 numbers passed as parameters

### Demo 2: Function Scope

Differentiate between block,local and global scope of a variable

1. Print numbers from 1-100 except multiples of 3 using block and local variables
2. Multiply 2 numbers and return the result using global variables
3. Calculate sum of the scores and display with the student's name using global variables

### Demo 3: Default Parameters

Assign value using default Parameters:

1. Calculate the maximum of given 2 numbers (second parameter is default)

### Demo 4: Pre-defined Functions

Some of the JavaScript pre-defined functions:

1. Display welcome message using alert method
2. Prompt the user to enter the name using prompt method
3. Confirm the user for his action using confirm method
4. Write a javascript function which does the following tasks:
    - Prompt the user to enter his name
    - Display "Invalid name" if the input name is not valid(having only numbers).
    - Allow the user to change his name if it is a valid name.
    - Display a welcome message if the user does not want to change the name.
    - The user should be able to change his name until he is not satisfied with the name.

### Demo 5 : Function Call stack

Function call stack to keep track of multiple function calls:

Write a program that helps teachers to classify grade based on the average marks​ of their students. Create separate functions for calculating total marks, calculating average marks and classifying grade based on average marks.​
