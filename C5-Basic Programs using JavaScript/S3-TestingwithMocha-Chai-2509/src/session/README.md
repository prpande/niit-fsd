## Sprint 2 : Implement Unit Testing using Mocha and Chai

### This sprint has 3 demos

[**Demo 1 :: Create Test Enabled JavaScript Application**](demo-1-create-test-enabled-application)

##### Problem Statement

Create JavaScript application and install Mocha and Chai to enable automated testing.

Note: Node.js is a pre-requisite for installing Mocha and Chai.

[**Demo 2 :: Compute Grades - Enable Testing**](demo-2-compute-grades-enable-testing)

##### Problem Statement

A JavaScript  program is written that computes grades based on the average marks obtained by the students to help teachers of grades 1 – 9 to prepare annual report. ​

​Separate functions are defined for calculating total marks, average scores and determining grades based on the average scores.

Write test cases that test these functions to ensure the code is defect free and generates the expected results.

[**Demo 3 :: Compute Grades - Refactor Code**](demo-3-compute-grades-refactor-code)

##### Problem Statement

The existing solution to compute grades is tested to ensure that the required functions exist and they return expected result for the valid inputs provide.

However, the code needs to be refactored to ensure that these functions return error messages for the invalid inputs passed.

Write test cases and refactor code to ensure that the code provides appropriate error messages for the invalid inputs passed.
