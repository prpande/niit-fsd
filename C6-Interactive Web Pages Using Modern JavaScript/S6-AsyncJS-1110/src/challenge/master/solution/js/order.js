// Reuse the solution created to dynamically create order form fields developed 
// in the previous sprint challenge

// Define function submitOrder to save the order details captured from the form 
// in json-server using Axios API

// Note:: As per test requirement, Order API should be running on port 3002

// The function should display the text `Total amount to be paid: $<value of total amount>` 
// after the details are successfully stored at the server



// do not delete the code given below, it is written to export the functions to be tested
module.exports = {
    submitOrder
}
