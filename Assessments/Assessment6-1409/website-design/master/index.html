        <h1>Dog Funny Event 2023</h1>
        <p>The 75th annual Dog Funny Event is being held in San Fransico City on September 1st.
            This is the funniest dog event of the year, starring over 300 different dogs. This event was made to show
            America how great dogs really are. There will be treats at the walk in, and for the dog owners there will be
            a buffet in the lounge. We thank you for coming to our event site, and hope to see you on September                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  1st.

        <p>These dogs will be the showrunners this year. Charlie has a long history in dog events, and is looking
            forward to this year's Dog Funny Event. Kate is a world-class runner, and will be showing his new techniques. Browny
            likes to lay around, and will practice his abilities. Jerry was invited because her mom made a fit about not
            coming.</p>
