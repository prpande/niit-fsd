## Activity - 1

### Write JavaScript programs **using functions** for the problem statements given below: (40 mins)

1. Calculate factorial of a given number. (20 mins)
    - For example, if the value of given number is 5, function should return 120. Since number 120 is the factorial of number 5.
        - factorial of n is n * n-1 * n-2 * n-3 ........ 1
    - The function should return message:
        - `Cannot calculate factorial of undefined`, if no argument is passed to the function.
        - `Cannot calculate factorial of a negative number`, if argument passed is a negative number.
        - `Cannot calculate factorial of a non-number`, if argument passed is not a number.
    - The solution for this problem should be written inside the file `solution/p1-factorial.js`.
2. Check whether the value of parameter passed to the function is a multiple of 7 or 11. (20 mins)
    - The function should return 
        - 0 if the number is not a multiple of 7 as well as 11,
        - 1 if the number is multiple of only 7, 
        - 2 if the number is multiple of only 11 and 
        - 3 if the number is multiple of 7 and 11 both. 
        - -1 if the type of parameter is not a number. 
    - The solution for this problem should be written inside the file `solution/p2-multiple-7-11.js`.

#### Instructions

1. The solution code should be written in the files stated above.
2. Ensure the code is neatly written, well-indented and adequately commented.
3. Check the output to ensure the expected requirement is fulfilled.

#### Submission Instructions

1. This assessment will be manually evaluated by the mentor.
2. Push the solution to git, after the solution code is developed.
3. Provide `Reporter` access for the solution repo to the mentor.
4. Share the link with mentor for evaluation .
