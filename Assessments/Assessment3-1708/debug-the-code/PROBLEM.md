# Course 2 - Sprint 4 - Assessment 3 - Debug the Code (Search)

**A linear search or sequential search is a method for finding 
an element within a list. It sequentially checks each 
element of the list until a match is found or the whole list 
has been searched**

A program is given that performs a liner search on an array of integers, and returns the index value where the element was found. If the element is not found it returns -1.

### Sample Input
    
    int arr[] = {5,6,7,8,21,3,4,9};
    int elementToBeSearched = 7


### Expected Output : 
    
    Element found at index 2

### Sample Input

    int arr[] = {5,6,7,8,21,3,4,9};
    int elementToBeSearched = 10


### Expected Output :

    Element not found returned index is -1


## Tasks :

    1. Identify the logical error in the given program and rectify them, so as to get the desired output.
    2. Execute the test cases given using stackcode, refer to README.md for the details.
