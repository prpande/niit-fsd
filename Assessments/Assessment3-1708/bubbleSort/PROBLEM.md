# Course 2 - Sprint 4 - Assessment 3 - Debug the Code (Sort)

**Bubble sort is a sorting algorithm that compares two adjacent elements and swaps them until they are in the intended order**

A program is given that performs sorting in ascending order on an array of integers.

### Sample Input
    
    int arr = new int[]{5,34,1,2,7,8,23,5,9,3,5,7,8};
    
### Expected Output : 
    
    The Sorted Array is : 1,2,3,5,5,5,7,7,8,8,9,23,34

### Sample Input

    int arr = new int[]{-9,-4,-7,-8,-23,-99,-66};

### Expected Output :

    The Sorted Array is : -99,-66,-23,-9,-8,-7,-4

## Tasks :

    1. Identify the logical error in the given program and rectify them, so as to get the desired output.
    2. Execute the test cases given using stackcode, refer to README.md for the details.
