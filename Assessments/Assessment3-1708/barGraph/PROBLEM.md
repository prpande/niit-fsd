# Bar Graph

A Bar Graph (also called Bar Chart) is a graphical display of data using bars of different heights.

Given an array of numbers, plot a bar graph horizontally with asterisk.
For example if the array holds a number 3, the bar graph must be represented as,

```text
3 ***
```

Sample Input :

```java
int[] scores = {1,7,9,4,3};
```

Expected Output :

```text
1 *
7 *******
9 *********
4 ****
3 ***
```

The program to print the graph is given, identify the errors in the code and print the result as expected.
