# Problem statement - 

Harry has just learned Spring Boot using Spring Data Jpa. He wants to create a Spring Boot application for managing his products. Help him create a REST API that will manage the Product information.

# The structure for the application is given. 

    Create a REST API that will manage the Product information. 

    Create the domain layer with the Product class that will store the information of products like productId, productName, productInformation, productDescription, productPrice. 
    
    Define the Repository Layer and use Spring Data JPA to perform MySQL database operations.

    Define the Service Layer that will contain methods to save, fetch all products, fetch a product by productId, delete a product by productId, fetch products by its price, and update the product details.

    Define the Controller Layer with handler methods for GET, PUT, POST, and DELETE. 
    
    Autowire the dependencies accordingly. 

    Test the output in Postman.
