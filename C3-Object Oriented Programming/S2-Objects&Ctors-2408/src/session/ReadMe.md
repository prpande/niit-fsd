# Library

Sam, a librarian in a college, is struggling to get his books organized.\
The college library contains books on the various courses they offer. As part of an initiative to reorganize the library and make it more accessible for the students, the college has decided to create a library management system to provide an online platform to search for and access various books and materials. As a part of this, Sam must create a `Book` class that will help the system organize the books.\
Help Sam create the class and capture minimum attributes like title, year of publishing, ISBN Number, and author name.

- Create an object for the `Book` class in an implementation `class Booklmpl`
- Initialize the variables in the no-argument constructor
- Display the details.
