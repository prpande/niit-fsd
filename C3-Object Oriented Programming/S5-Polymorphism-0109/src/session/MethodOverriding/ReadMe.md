# Method Overriding

- Write a Java program to calculate the salaries of `SalesManager` and `TechLead`
- `SalesManager` and `TechLead` extend the `Employee` class and override all its method.
- Inside the `main` method, create the object of the `SalesManager` and `TechLead` classes, call the calculate salary method, and print the respective salary
