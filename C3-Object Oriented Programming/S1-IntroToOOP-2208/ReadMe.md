# Introduction to Object-Oriented Programming

- normal language programming — procedural paradigm — step by Step
- C++- not pure- code can be written without classes and object + main() is not inside any class
- .Net, Java- Pure OOP

attributes in a class
every object is having own attributes
methods are created in memory and they are shared by objects

three types of classes in java:

1. Execution class--runnable class(used to run the program)
--this is main class as inside main method we can call methods from other classes.
2. definition Employee and method and u can define objects Of that class
3. inheritance - derived/abstract class

OOP--through OOP it is possible to model the functions and attributes of a real world object into a programming object
