#### Tony and John are playing a reverse array game where one of them is going to give an array to another.
#### The other person needs to reverse the array and display the output. If any one of them fails to reverse the array, the game ends.

#### Write a Java program that reverses the array, stores the reversed array in another array, and prints it.

#### Below are the task 

##### 1. Write all the logic for the program inside the ReverseArrayDemo class provided.

##### 2. Write the logic to reverse the given Array inside the below method and return the reverse array.
    
    public int[] getReverseArray(int [] array)

##### 3. Inside the main method . 
    Declare and initialize values of an Array.
        int array[] = {23,34,43,56,67,78,43,35};
    Create an object of the class ReverseArrayDemo.
    Call the method reverseArrayDemo() and store the array returned in another array

#### 4. Sample Input -
        int array[] = {23,34,43,56,67,78,43,35};

#### 5. Sample Output - 
        Int reverseArray = {35,43,78,67,56,43,34,23};

#### 6. Execute the test cases provided in the test folder.
