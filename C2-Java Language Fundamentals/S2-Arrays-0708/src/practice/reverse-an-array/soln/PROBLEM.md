# Practice Challenge - Reverse an Array

Tony and John are playing a reverse array game where one of them is going to give an array to another.
The other person needs to reverse the array and display the output. If any one of them fails to reverse the array, the game ends.

Write a Java program that reverses the array, stores the reversed array in another array, and prints it

## Below are the tasks

1. Write all the logic for the program inside the ReverseArrayDemo class provided

2. Write the logic to reverse the given Array inside the below method and return the reverse array

    ```java
    public int[] getReverseArray(int [] array)
    ```

3. Inside the `main` method, declare and initialize values of an array.

    ```java
    int array[] = {23,34,43,56,67,78,43,35};
    ```

    Create an object of the class `ReverseArrayDemo`.
    Call the method `getReverseArray()` and store the array returned in another array

4. Sample Input

    ```java
    int array[] = {23,34,43,56,67,78,43,35};
    ```

5. Sample Output

    ```less
    Int reverseArray = {35,43,78,67,56,43,34,23};
    ```

6. Execute the test cases provided in the test folder
