# Implement Sorting on Arrays - 10/08

## Searching

### Linear Search

- Simplest searching algorithm
- Sequential search
- Search by examining the elements in an array one by one starting from the first element
- Comparison with elements continues till the element is found or we reach the end of array
- Sample Code for linear search located in method `linearSearch()` in *src\session\SearchingAlgorithms.java.java*
  
### Binary Search

- Used for searching large lists
- Searches in least possible number of comparisons
- Array should be **sorted**
- Sample Code for binary search located in method `binarySearch()` in *src\session\SearchingAlgorithms.java.java*
