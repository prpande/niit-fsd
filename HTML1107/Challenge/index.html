        <p>ULTIMATE DINING EXPERIENCE LIKE NO OTHER</p>
        <p>
            Tasty Delights was started in May 2018 when there was a need for sandwiches on a sailboat snorkeling tour. 
            Looking at the opportunity we thought it was a great chance to start our venture. 
            We offered our services to the construction workers on the island as well as the general population who liked our services and products.

            Customers were always amazed by the variety of dishes we offered on a daily basis. 
            Since then we have grown from a small 6 employee unit to a now twenty person strong employee base. 
            We have become a household name in Bahamas. 
            We have countless customers that walk through our doors and make it a point to let us know that we are their first stop from the airport to the city. 
            Our customers always appreciate our taste, smell, friendliness, great presentation and that special delight.
